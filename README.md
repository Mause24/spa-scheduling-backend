## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```
## Configurar .env
when they download the github repository through the command (git clone https://github.com/Mause24/spa-scheduling-backend.git)
Once the project is in place, use the following command (npm install) to install all the necessary modules.

After having everything in the root folder, we create a file with a name (.env), in order to have our user environment variables.

Inside that file will be the following: 

## USER_ID = 1 
## USER_NAME = Admin 
## USER_EMAIL = admin@gmail.com   
## USER_PASSWORD = 123456

In each of the fields you can modify them as you wish, the previous one is an example of how to do it.
Now with all this you can run the application through the command:
$ npm run start

Now with this we go to the postma to try.

## Postman
Have postman installed or start it in the web browser, enter your account and then enter the work team through the following link: [team](https://app.getpostman.com/join-team?invite_code=6e34b34af1f6893905d01c6dd9549743&target_code=22d36e16a26adbd2e11ca0b8d090d9d9)

After doing all of the above in postman they will go to workspace and then they will go to Team Workspace, and they will have a folder with a name (spaScheduling), when they open that folder several folders will be displayed and we will only enter the one with the name (Auth), There we will have two routes, one that allows us to log in and the other allows us to verify if the token is correct.

after that in the upper right part we select our environment variable called (DEV), which will have our local url.

Once we have everything, we first execute the login route passing our credentials in the body.

and we give send to send the request and it does not return a response with the accesToken.

Then we can test the other route (ProtectedRoute), with the token that we generated but it is not necessary since in the authorization part there is a collection where the token is saved automatically.
Then we can give send and try that route and get a message and user that is authorized.

 [jwt](https://jwt.io/) Through this site, we can verify that it brings us the token, so we copy the token that was generated and paste it into the aforementioned website.
## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
